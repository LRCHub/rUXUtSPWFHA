I need your love, I need your time.
When everything's wrong, you make it right.
I feel so high, I come alive,
I need to be free with you tonight.
I need your love.
I need your love.
I take a deep breath
every time I pass your door,
I know you're there
but I can't see you anymore.
And that's the reason, you're in the dark,
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart.
And I feel so helpless here,
watch my eyes are filled with fear.
Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again.
I need your love, I need your time,
when everything's wrong you make it right.
I feel so high, like you're alive,
I need to be free with you tonight.
I need your love.
I need your love.
Am I dreaming? Will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out,
what I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this
but I know I'm not that strong.
And I feel so helpless here,
watch my eyes are filled with fear.
Tell me do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again.
I need your love, I need your time.
When everything's wrong you make it right,
I feel so high,
like you're alive.
I need to be free with you tonight.
I need your love.
I need your love.
All the years, all the times
you have never been to blame
and now my eyes are open
and now my heart is closing.
All the tears, all the lies, all the ways
I've been trying to make a change,
and now my eyes are open.
I need your love, I need your time.
When everything's wrong you make it right,
I feel so high, I come alive.
I need to be free.
